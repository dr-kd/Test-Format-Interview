NAME
    Text::Format::Interview - Take a text interview transcript and format to
    html.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Text::Format::Interview;

     my $txt = Text::Format::Interview->new();
     my $html = $txt->process($string);

    Converts text of the form:

      # Interview between Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, 3rd April, 2000 BC

      Fred: [00:00:00]
      So, Barney, when did you decide to become a Flintstone?

      Barney: [00:00:10]
      Well Fred, I'm not actually a Flintstone, my surname is Rubble and I live in Bedrock.

    Into HTML, something like:

      # Interview between Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, 3rd April, 2000 BC

      <h2>Fred: [00:00:00]</h2>
      <p>So, Barney, when did you decide to become a Flintstone?</p>

    This is intended as a pre-processor, so the header is using markdown
    here, but could equally be html.

    Alternatively if you specify a comma separated list of "interviewers"
    and "interviewees" at the top of the file to be processed, you'll get
    some css classes as well:

      # Interview between Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, 3rd April, 2000 BC
      interviewer: fred,wilma
      interviewee: barney,betty

      Fred: [00:00:00]
      So what's it like to be a flintstone?

      Barney: [00:00:05]
      I'm not a Flintstone, I'm a Rubble.  What do you think Betty?

      Betty:  [00:00:10]
      Yes Fred, you're confused.

      Wilma:  [00:00:15]
      I'm so terribly embarrassed by my husband.

    Which ought to render to:

      # Interview between Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, 3rd April, 2000 BC

      <p>interviewer: fred, wilma <br>
      interviewee: barney, betty <br></p>

      <h2 class="interviewer">Fred: [00:00:00]</h2>
      <p>So what's it like to be a flintstone?</p>

      <h2 class="interviewee">Barney: [00:00:05]</p>
      <p>I'm not a Flintstone, I'm a Rubble.  What do you think Betty?</p>

    This gives us the ability to put pretty colours in the interview
    transcript with CSS, something like this:

      h2.interviewer > p { color: red }

    (or something far more tortorous if you need to Internet Explorer 6
    support ...)

FUNCTIONS
  process
    Takes the text, and spits out the html.
